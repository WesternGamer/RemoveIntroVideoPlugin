# RemoveIntroVideoPlugin
This plugin disables the intro video that is played when you open Space Engineers. While there are other ways to disable the intro video, this plugin makes disabling the intro video more streamlined when used with PluginLoader.

## Plugin Installation
To use the plugin, please install [PluginLoader](https://github.com/austinvaness/PluginLoader). After you install PluginLoader successfully, go to the plugins menu from the main menu and select Remove Intro Video Plugin. Click Apply and you will be asked to restart the game. Click Yes to restart the game and you done! Manual Plugin Installation without PluginLoader is not offically supported! To re-enable the intro video, just simply disable the plugin from the plugins menu!
